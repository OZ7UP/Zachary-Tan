My name is Zachary Tan, but please feel free to call me "Zach". I am a Singaporean-born Australian currently residing and working in Nagasaki City, Japan, as an Assistant Language Teacher.

My passions include music, working out, travelling, photography, language education, language learning, coffee, and trying out new things from time to time. In fact, this website is one of two that I've created in order to indulge in some basic coding, the other being for [my band](https://roseburnavenuemusic.com).

I also hope to use my personal website to showcase how I view the world through my photography edits. I do have a fair warning: coffee is not guaranteed in any of the pictures I choose to share. I simply wanted to be cute with the name for the website.
