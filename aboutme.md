My name is Zachary Tan, but please feel free to call me "Zach". I am a Singaporean-born Australian currently residing and working in Nagasaki City, Japan, as an Assistant Language Teacher.

My passions include music, working out, travelling, photography, language education, language learning, coffee, and trying out new things from time to time. In fact, this website is one of two that I've created in order to indulge in some basic coding, the other being for [my band](https://roseburnavenuemusic.com){:target="_blank"}.

The main premise of my website is to share snapshots of my life. This does not necessarily mean just literal snapshots. If the general purpose of a snapshot is to capture the moment, the purpose of my writing is to capture my thoughts and ideas for any given time.

The bit about coffee? I usually tend to be hopped up on either the titular drink or my usual pre-workout whenever I decide to hit the keyboard. I'm also focusing on tidying up my writing so that each post can be read in the same time it takes to enjoy a (double-) shot of espresso.
