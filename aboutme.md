My name is Zachary Tan, but please feel free to call me "Zach". I am a Singaporean-born Australian currently residing and working in Nagasaki City, Japan, as an Assistant Language Teacher.

My passions include music, working out, travelling, photography, language education, language learning, and trying out new things from time to time. In fact, this website is one of two that I've created in order to indulge in some basic coding, the other being for [my band](https://roseburnavenuemusic.com).

(Keep in mind that I am using a different design template for my personal site compared to the one for my band and, as such, you will either have to use your browser's navigation buttons or the navigation function on the top right corner to head anywhere else. Clicking on my face or on the header name will lead you nowhere. Please be patient while I learn how to sort this out through trial and error.)

I also hope to use my personal website to showcase how I view the world through my photography edits. I do have a fair warning: coffee is not guaranteed in any of the pictures I choose to share. I simply wanted to be cute with the name for the website.
