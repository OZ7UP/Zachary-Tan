I try to make it a point to learn something new every day. It doesn't matter if it's learning how to use GitHub, trying out a new app, or understanding a particular grammar point in a foreign language - if it's something new, I'm all up for it.

The key to doing so, however, involves using every single piece of knowledge related to the topic. In the end, regardless of the pedagogical approach applied, learning is a constructivist activity, with your prior knowledge serving as a base for future knowledge acquisition.

Let's consider the use of DuoLingo as a language learning tool. Some people will argue that it is not the best way to pick up native-level fluency in a foreign language. I'm one of those. Yet, I would still happily recommend it to anyone who's even remotely interested in trying out a new foreign language, regardless of their reason. Why is this the case?

It's simple - for its faults, DuoLingo does a good job at introducing you to a range of vocabulary and grammar points, even using nonsensical scenarios to make it easier for you to remember the material you are acquiring. The more you keep revising a particular grammar point (and its associated vocabulary), the more likely you are to remember it.

Of course, simply remembering what you have learnt is not good enough. To make things stick, you need to form connections between the new and the old. The easiest way to do this with DuoLingo is to simply look up the comments section for any one particular question, regardless of whether you got it right or wrong. You'll find people actively discussing the question, with native and near-native language users attempting to keep explanations simple AND relatable. That second bit is highly important as you try to find connections between what you are learning and what you already know.

As you can infer, the repetitive nature of DuoLingo can be a strength when used in conjunction with other learning resources, simply by virtue of you hopefully remembering the knowledge you have acquired. I typically use DuoLingo in conjunction with "Wani-Kani" and "Bunpro" with my Japanese studies - the advantage of doing so is is that the latter two help <i>refine</i> my understanding of what I have learnt from the former.

You still need to put what you have learnt to practice, which often means communicating with a native-level user of the target language. Whether you choose to do so is up to you, but I wouldn't let the opportunity pass by because I would get to learn how to further refine my theoretical knowledge through practical usage.

Ultimately, if you want to learn a new language, be prepared to throw everything that you know at the challenge.
